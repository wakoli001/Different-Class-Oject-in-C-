📚 C++ Object-Oriented Programming Demo
Book and Car Class Implementation
📖 Overview

This project is a foundational C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) demonstration that showcases the creation and usage of custom classes.

The program defines two classes:

Book

Car

It then creates multiple objects from these classes, assigns values to their attributes, and displays the stored information using standard console output.

This project is designed for beginners learning the core principles of C++ and OOP.

🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

Demonstrate class definition in C++

Illustrate object instantiation

Show attribute assignment using dot notation

Practice formatted console output

Reinforce understanding of public class members

🚀 Future Improvements

To enhance this project further, the following improvements can be implemented:

Add constructors for better initialization

Implement member functions inside classes

Use private attributes with getters and setters (Encapsulation)

Accept user input dynamically

Store multiple objects using arrays or std::vector

Add file handling for data persistence

Implement inheritance for extended functionality
